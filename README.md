BasicKernel
===========
This is code that I've been writing for a basic kernel from the [Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Eexr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) book.

Compiling
---------
I cross-compile from `x86_64` to `x86` (64 to 32-bit) on my machine, but all the code is plain `x86`. To compile just run the makefile.

License
-------
Since this code is made with the help of the above mentioned book so generously created (yet incomplete), I've licensed this repo under the [Unlicense](/LICENSE).
